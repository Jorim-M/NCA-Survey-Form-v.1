# NCA-Survey-Form-v.1
An online survey form I built for the National Construction Authority (Nairobi, Kenya).

Now defunct, the survey was in use between June 2021 and July 2021.

The objective of the survey was to collect expression of interest in registering resource personnel.

This is the first version of the applcation.

In this project learnt how to use PHP & MySQL specifically for multiple user data collection.
